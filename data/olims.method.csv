method_tr,Titration,A titration is a method of analysis that will allow you to determine the precise endpoint of a reaction and therefore the precise quantity of reactant in the titration flask. A buret is used to deliver the second reactant to the flask and an indicator of pH Meter is used to detect the endpoint of the reaction,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, dis laoreet eleifend wisi, phasellus adipiscing maecenas enim pharetra fermentum, mauris arcu sed quis, ante eros eleifend mollis integer lorem.

method_rtpcr,RT-PCR,"Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction - Powerful technique for producing millions of copies of specific parts of the genetic code of an organism so that it may be readily analyzed. More specifically, RT-PCR produces copies of a specific region of complementary DNA that has been converted from RNA. The technique is often used to help in the identification of an infectious agent","Vestibulum eget tincidunt ipsum mauris suspendisse, dictum at, faucibus habitasse consequat, orci turpis in sed amet ut, ullamcorper pellentesque semper ipsum magna sit.

method_fia,FIA,"Flow Injection Analysis - microchemical technique to automate wet chemical methods. In a FIA system, a carrier solution and the chemical reagents are continuously pumped through tubes, mixing coils and finally through a flow cell in a detector. A small portion of the sample is injected into the carrier. The carrier merges with one or more reagents to produce a chemical reaction. The resulting colour change in the sample zone is measured in the detector. The time between injection and detection is typically 1 minute. The dispersion or dilution of the sample zone is controlled by the system components, i.e. injected volume, flow rates and length and diameter of the tubing. When the dispersed sample zone reaches the flow cell of the detector neither the chemical reaction nor the dispersion process must have reached completion or a steady state. Keeping identical conditions for both samples and standards makes evaluation and quantification reproducible and precise","Eget urna gravida luctus. Vestibulum faucibus vel, lacinia vivamus.

The amount of protein or other antigen in a given sample is determined by means of an enzyme-catalysed colour change, avoiding both the hazards and expense of radioactive techniques. www.fao.org. an assay that relies on an enzymatic conversion reaction and is used to detect the presence of specific substances such as enzymes or viruses or antibodies or bacteria. wordnet.princeton.edu. A positive ELISA test generally is confirmed by the Western Blot test Method document:","Diam accumsan litora arcu lectus. Ut perferendis scelerisque a, vel leo sodales ac at venenatis bibendum.

method_aes,AES,Auger Electron Spectroscopy - Auger (pronounced ~o-jay) electron spectroscopy is an electron spectroscopic method that uses a beam of electrons to knock electrons out of inner-shell orbitals. Auger electrons are ejected to conserve energy when electrons in higher shells fill the vacancy in the inner shell. These Auger electrons have energies characteristic of the emitting atom due to the characteristic energy-level structure of that element,"Donec senectus elit luctus dignissim, lorem vitae neque, nec est gravida lorem ultricies egestas ultrices, quam dolor mi amet.

Massa imperdiet et, nunc vel sed elementum aenean sed a, nec ipsum ligula voluptate iaculis minim sodales, nibh lorem proin taciti quam."
method_dbsinad,12 dB SINAD,"The most common use of the SINAD measurement is to assess the sensitivity performance of a radio receiver. To achieve this the sensitivity can be assessed by determining the RF input level at the antenna that is required to achieve a given figure of SINAD. Normally a SINAD value of 12 dB is taken as this corresponds to a distortion factor of 25%, and a modulating tone of 1 kHz is used. It is also necessary to determine other conditions. For AM it is necessary to specify the depth of modulation and for FM the level of deviation is required. For FM analogue systems ETSI specifies the use of a deviation level of 12.5% of the channel spacing A typical specification might be that a receiver has a sensitivity of 0.25 uV [microvolts] for a 12 dB SINAD. Obviously the lower the input voltage needed to achieve the given level of SINAD, the better the receiver performance.","Ante sit morbi habitasse, risus augue velit tellus augue, enim sit vitae a.
